# ⚙️ Backend Engineer • Automation Developer • Ethical Hacker • Full-Stack MERN Dev

Hi, I’m **Iyosiyas** — a self-taught developer from **Addis Ababa, Ethiopia**, building real-world systems with a focus on:

🔧 **Backend engineering** with FastAPI & Node.js  
🤖 **Automation tools** for bots, fintech, and reporting  
🛡 **Ethical hacking** & cybersecurity lab projects  
🌐 **Full-stack apps** using the MERN stack

My goal is to create secure, automated, and scalable systems that solve real-world problems — and to freelance globally while sharing knowledge locally.
