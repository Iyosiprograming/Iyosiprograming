# 👋 Hi, I'm Iyosiyas

**🚀 Self-Taught Developer | Building My Way Into Tech**  
📍 Addis Ababa, Ethiopia | 💌 [iyosieyosiyas@gmail.com](mailto:iyosieyosiyas@gmail.com)  

I'm a self-taught programmer with a CS degree that doesn't tell my full story. My grades aren't great, but I'm building my way into a software development career through consistent projects and learning in public.

I document everything I do: from learning new skills and building projects to job applications and interview lessons. This is my public developer journey.
